Implement the design(mockup.jpg) into a webpage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Please refrain from using any JavaScript/CSS libraries and frameworks. Your solution should meet the following requirements:

1) The left sidebar with the navigation should be fixed, while the right content is vertically scrollable.

2) Include the font icon library found at http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/. And use the following font icons:
	<i class="material-icons">explore</i>
	<i class="material-icons">folder</i>
	<i class="material-icons">cloud_upload</i>
	<i class="material-icons">favorite</i>
	<i class="material-icons">grade</i>
	<i class="material-icons">sort_by_alpha</i>

3) Parse the JSON file(data.json) and display its contents in the DOM and do the following:
	- when the page loads, make an Ajax request to get the contents from data.json
	- only display items where "is_published‚Äù = true
	- the first letter of each word for the title should be capitalized
	- by default, items should display alphabetically in descending order by title

4) Clicking the "AZ" font icon should toggle between sorting in ascending and descending order by title.

5) The page should be as close to the mockup as possible.

6) When finished, zip and upload your solution through the HackerRank website.

Good luck!
